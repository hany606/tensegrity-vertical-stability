The NTRTsim portion of the NTRT is made possible by a number of other 
third-party open source libraries. We do not directly redistribute any
of these libraries, and your use of them is dependent upon your own
download and installation of those libraries, and acceptance of their
individual license agreements.  In order to make installation easy, we
have provided configuration scripts which will fetch and install the
required libraries for you.  The key third party libraries NTRTsim
depends upon are:
- Boost C++ Libraries: http://www.boost.org/
- The Bullet Physics Library: http://bulletphysics.org
- FreeGLUT: http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/
