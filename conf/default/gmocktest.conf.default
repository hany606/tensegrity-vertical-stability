# Purpose: Define configuration directives for setup_gmocktest.sh. 
# Date:    2014-08-18
# Usage:   Copy/rename this file to '../gmocktest.conf' and run setup.sh

# GMockTest installation prefix

# Global install: /usr/local, env install: "$ENV_DIR"
# By default, setup will download and install GMockTest under your env directory.
# If you have an existing GMockTest install, you should change 
# GMOCKTEST_INSTALL_PREFIX to what was used for installation (likely /usr/local).
GMOCKTEST_INSTALL_PREFIX="$ENV_DIR"

# Location where GMockTest is to be built if necessary, or where it was built if 
# you're using an existing package. This doesn't need to be set unless gmocktest is
# not already installed. 
GMOCKTEST_BUILD_DIR="$ENV_DIR/build/gmocktest_1_7"

# This is the location where you unzipped the package (or, where it will
# be unzipped if necessary). 
GMOCKTEST_PACKAGE_DIR="$GMOCKTEST_BUILD_DIR"

# GMOCKTEST_URL can be either a web address or a local file address,
# e.g. http://url.com/for/gmocktest.tgz or file:///path/to/gmocktest.tgz
