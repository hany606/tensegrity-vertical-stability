# Purpose: Define configuration directives for setup_neuralnet.sh. 
# Date:    2014-08-27
# Usage:   Copy/rename this file to '../jsoncpp.conf' and run setup.sh

# Neural Net installation prefix

# Global install: /usr/local, env install: "$ENV_DIR"
# By default, setup will download and install Anguelov's neural net library under your env directory.
# If you have an existing install, you should change 
# NEURALNET_INSTALL_PREFIX to what was used for installation (likely /usr/local).
NEURALNET_INSTALL_PREFIX="$ENV_DIR"

# This is the location where you unzipped the package (or, where it will
# be unzipped if necessary). 
NEURALNET_PACKAGE_DIR="$ENV_DIR/build/neuralNet"

# Location where Anguelov's neural net library is to be built if necessary, or where it was built if 
# you're using an existing package. This doesn't need to be set unless Anguelov's neural net library is
# not already installed. 
# This library has subfolders in its zip, so if you're unpacking, the subfolder will be set for you
NEURALNET_BUILD_DIR="$NEURALNET_PACKAGE_DIR/nnImplementationV2/Neural Network v2"

# NEURALNET_URL can be either a web address or a local file address,
# e.g. http://url.com/for/jsoncpp.tgz or file:///path/to/jsoncpp.tgz
#NEURALNET_URL="http://ntrt.perryb.ca/storage/dependencies/nnImplementationV2.zip"
