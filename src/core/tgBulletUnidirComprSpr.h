/**
 * This class defines the passive dynamics of a compression spring
 * system, with damping, in the Bullet physics engine.
 * It extends tgBulletCompressionSpring, and changes the way that forces
 * are applied: instead of calculating and applying force along the vector
 * between the two anchor points, it only calculates/applies force along
 * one of the axes: X, Y or Z.
 * So for example, if it's only in Z, one anchor could move around in X or Y
 * and the applied force wouldn't change.
 * Here, we use "Unidir" to mean "Unidirectional."

     * @param[in] anchors - a list of this spring cable's attachements
     * @param[in] isFreeEndAttached - boolean flag.
     * If no, the spring only provides compression force. 
     * If yes, the spring is "attached" to both anchors, and provides a 
     * tension force too when the distance between anchors is greater 
     * than rest length.
     * @param[in] coefK - the stiffness of the spring. Must be positive
     * @param[in] dampingCoefficient - the damping in the spring. Must be non-negative.
     * @param[in] restLength - the length of the compression spring when unloaded.
     * @param[in] direction - the direction of the force to be applied, a btVector3.
     * the current version will only support (1,0,0), (0,1,0), or (0,0,1), or
     * the negatives of those vectors.
     * NOTE that if the To anchor is in the negative direction with respect to the
     * From anchor, then direction should be NEGATIVE.
     * NOTE that although direction is a pointer, it is not deleted in this class 
     * or any of the other related classes in core. That is because
     * it's stored in the const Config struct of an application: it's only 
     * created once, not dynamically, so it's only deleted at the very 
     * end of the application (NOT during any individual setups or teardowns.)
