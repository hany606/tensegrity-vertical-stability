/**
 \page dev Dev Folder
 The dev directory holds a number of models we used to test while developing
 the library, and some areas of active research, like strings with
 contact dynamics. Documentation may be quite sparse, but all applications
 should at least run under version 1.0.0
 
 \version 1.0.0 (beta)
