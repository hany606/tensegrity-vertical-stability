 * Note that unlike tgRodSensor etc., a tgCompoundRigidSensor

 * In order for this sensor framework to function "nicely", one 
 * tgCompoundRigidSensor should only output data from one compound rigid.
 * That requires specifying WHICH compound rigid to sense, since many
 * tgModels have more than one compound rigid inside them.
