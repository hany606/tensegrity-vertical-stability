 * tgCompoundRigidSensorInfo is a sensor info class that creates sensors for
 * compound rigid bodies. It creates a sensor for any tgSenseable object that:
 * (1) is a tgModel with at least two descendants
 * (2) at least two of the descendants, both of which can be cast to tgBaseRigids,
 *     have matching "compound_XXXXXX" tags
 * See the implementation of these functions for more details about how many sensors
 * are created. If used properly (e.g. this is the only tgCompoundRigidSensorInfo in the
 * application), there should not be any redundant sensors created.
