 * This class defines methods for use with sensors.
 * Any individual sensor (ex., a tgRodSensor) will need to re-implement
 * both of these methods.
 * Note that we make everything pure virtual here to force re-definition.
 * Sensing data from objects occurs in two places in the NTRTsim workflow.
 * First, when setting up the simulation, a heading for the data is given.
 * This describes the data that will be returned.
 * Second, when the simulation is running, the data itself can be taken.
 * Note that it's up to the caller (e.g., a tgDataLogger2) to match up the headings
 * with the data.

   * object that a sensor works on.
   * The reason why we declare it here as a pointer to the parent class
   * is for setup reasons: we want a tgDataLogger2 to be able to ask this
   * class, "Can you sense a particular tgSenseable?".
   * The way to do that is to pass in a pointer of the parent type,
   * and attempt a cast to the child type via a call to tgCast.
