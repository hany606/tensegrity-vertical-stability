 * Note that an individual tgSensorInfo may return multiple sensors upon a single

   * Next, this class needs to be able to actually create one or more sensors.
   * @param[in] pSenseable a pointer to the tgSenseable object that is to be sensed.
   * @return a vector of pointers to any sensors that were created. This list can have zero elements,
   * for example in the case that all possible sensors have already been created for an object.
   * Note that it's up to the subclasses to make sure that redundant sensors are not created.
   * One way to do this, for example, is to only create sensors for the "leaf" descendants.
   * That would be how (for example) tgRodSensorInfo works: by only creating sensors for
   * tgSenseables that can be cast to tgRods, we can be sure that only one sensors is made per rod,
   * since any individual rod will only be passed in ONCE to this function.
   * However, for more complicated situations, like tgCompoundRigidSensor, a subclass would need
   * to keep track of e.g. which compound rigids have been assigned a sensor, so as to not
   * create multiple for the same compound rigid.
   * In short, return the least number of sensors possible, and if dealing directly with children
   * of tgModel, then don't create any sensors for the tgModel itself, just its children.
