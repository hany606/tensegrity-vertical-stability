/**
 * Implementation of a box shape as defined by a 'from' point and a 'to'
 * point. It also has length, width and density.
 * This 'info' class will also detect and add nodes that are along the outside
 * edge of the box (as of 2016-08-31, actually adds nodes on or INSIDE the box,
 * which is not the behavior we want, but is good enough for the ForcePlateModel
 *
 * NOTE THAT THIS CLASS DOES NOT WORK WELL AT THE MOMENT. 
 *     A discussion on the limitations of NTRT's creation of boxes
 *     is present in tgBoxMoreAnchors.cpp, but briefly: since NTRTsim does not
 *     specify an orientation for a box, the width and height directions currently
 *     are chosen ARBITRARILY by the underlying Bullet Physics methods. As a result,
 *     this class will sometimes break for no reason. That would occur if Bullet
 *     chooses which parameter is width and which is height in a different way
 *     than is assumed here. To fix this, we'd want to change how boxes are
 *     specified, but that means changing tgBox, which may affect other code...
