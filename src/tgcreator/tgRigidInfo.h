/**
 * A collector for keeping track of all of the necessary components of a
 * rigid model during the build process. Information is filled in in the
 * following order:
 *   1. Structural information (different for each subclass) that is 
 *      necessary for subsequent steps (e.g. radius, density, and end 
 *      points for a rod)
 *   2. m_collisionShape -- the information from #1 is used to create
 *      an appropriate btCollisionShape. Note that a btCollisionShape 
 *      does not have mass or placement info, it's just a shape.
 *   3. m_rigidGroup -- this is usually filled in by a tgStructureInfo 
 *      object during the groupRigids() operation that is required for
 *      auto-compounding. If the group is not set, a pointer to self is
 *      returned. If you know your rigid does not share any nodes with 
 *      other rigids, you can skip setting this and things will still work.
 *   4. m_rigidBody -- This is the actual representation of the rigid
 *      for Bullet Physics to use. We keep a pointer to it here so that
 *      tgConnectorInfo objects that point to this can be translated into
 *      tgModels. 
 *
 * Note: A tgRigidInfo is a tree. If it is not compound, the tree has one node.
